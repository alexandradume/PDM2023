I used TypeScript and Ionic to create an application that:
  * generates some restaurants that have an id, name and number of stars
  * changes data from an item that already exist
  * creates a new item
The code from the server side is on brench server, and the frontend is on ionic-app

My Entity is Restaurant: id(string), name(string), number of stars as number(number)
